# Data Logger
Measure, display and log temperatures with Raspberry PI 3B.

This is a simple hobby project for logging temperatures of my heat pump and heating system.

## Features

### Current Temperatures
Show the current readings

### Temperature Graphs
Show how temperatures developed over the last 24 hours

### MQTT Client
Publish all temperature readings to a MQTT broker. This allows to track and show them in common MQTT apps.
The MQTT messages contain JSON with timestamp and value:

    { "status": "ok", "timestamp": "2020-11-13T17:08:57.753064", "value": 9.697, "unit": "Â°C", "formatted": "9.7" }

### CSV Logging
The temperature readings are written to CSV files and held for 32 days. This also allows to immediately re-fill the graphs view after restart.

## Hardware

- Raspberry PI 3B
- Official Raspberry PI 7" touch display, 800x480 (expensive, but well supported in Raspbian, multi-touch)
- Official Raspberry power supply 5.1V/2.5A with additional 330uF capacitor for stabilization (Raspi is quite picky here...)
- Heat sink on Raspberry CPU (... to avoid the random crashes that may occur otherwise)
- DS 18B20 temperature sensors (1-Wire bus allows many sensors at the same GPIO port, well supported in Raspbian)
- TSIC 306 temperature sensors (high accurracy, expensive, but already installed from a previous project)

## Platform

- Raspbian Buster
- Python 3.7
- UI toolkit Kivy (nice and simple UIs with multi-touch support)
- Charts with Kivy Garden Graph (fast drawing)
- TSIC temperature sensors: python module tsic (sensor reading based on pigpio)
- GPIO access: pigpio (IO with precise timing)

## Installation / Configuration

Steps last performed on latest Raspbian of 2021-01-23
```
# Install Raspbian buster to SD card,
# optionally create files "ssh" and "wpa_supplicant.conf" according to doc
# in boot partition for set-up without keybord and monitor before initial boot,
# boot Raspi and ssh to raspberrypi as user pi password raspberry,
# change user pi's password to a secure one!

# Desktop packages
sudo apt update
sudo api install lightdm lxsession 

# Basic config
sudo raspi-config
- set hostname
- set time zone
- enable VNC for remote access to desktop
- enable 1-Wire
- set boot to desktop with auto-login

# GPIO access for TSIC sensor support
sudo apt install pigpio
sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
sudo systemctl start pigpiod

# Data-logger and required packages
sudo apt install python3-pip
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/grillbaer/data-logger.git
cd data-logger

# For data-logger configuration change data-logger/signalsourcesconfig.py,
# you may use testsignalsourcesconfig.py for demo simulation

# MQTT secret and TLS certificate
echo "my-secret-mqtt-broker-password" >data-logger/secret-mqtt-password
cp my-mqtt-broker-public-root-certificate >mqtt_broker_cacert.pem
# set mqtt_broker_host: '' in signalsourcesconfig.py to disable MQTT
```

- Log files path `logs/`
- CSV files path `csv/`
- Discover the DS18B20 sensor IDs in `/sys/bus/w1/devices/` 
- Configure data logger by changing `signalsourcesconfig.py`
- Prefer WLAN to LAN to avoid power surges depending on sensor cabling!
